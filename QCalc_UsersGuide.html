</p>

  <p>There are some points to note besides those in the "Usage"
  section of the <a href="index.html#QCalc">top-level documentation</a>:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn off unit checking in Dymola:
        <pre>
    Advanced.CheckUnits = false;</pre>
        This is automatic if
        <a href="index.html#QCalc">QCalc</a> is loaded via
        <a href="https://github.com/kdavies4/QCalc/blob/master/load.mos">load.mos</a>.</li>

        <li>Call <a href="QCalc_Units.html#QCalc.Units.setup">QCalc.Units.setup</a>() to
        establish the display units in Dymola.  This is automatic if
        <a href="index.html#QCalc">QCalc</a> is loaded via
        <a href="https://github.com/kdavies4/QCalc/blob/master/load.mos">load.mos</a>.</li>

<li>Note that angle is explicit in the definitions of quantities,
        units, and constants. This helps to identify dimensional inconsistencies
        and provide insight into the physical equations.
        Sometimes it is necessary to include factors
        of <code>U.rad</code>, <code>U.cyc</code>, etc. (where <code>U</code> is
        <a href="QCalc_Units.html#QCalc.Units">QCalc.Units</a>), but usually
        those units cancel.  See <a href="QCalc_Units.html#QCalc.Units">QCalc.Units</a>
        for details on where this is important.</li>

        <li>The global variable <code>time</code> is in seconds.  It is not a
        quantity, so it must be multiplied by the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second">unit second</a>
        (<code>U.s</code>) when used with other quantities.
        When writing a derivative, it is important to divide the result of
        the <code>der</code> operator by the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second">unit second</a>: <code>der(x)/U.s</code>.
        By default, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second">second</a>
        has a value of one, but this will not be the case if the base constants
        are changed.</li>

        <li>When using results based on <a href="index.html#QCalc">QCalc</a>
        in an external tool, note that the values
        of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">SI</a>
        base and coherently derived units are not necessarily one.  The values
        can be loaded from the "units.mos" file that is automatically
        generated by <a href="https://github.com/kdavies4/QCalc/blob/master/load.mos">load.mos</a>
        in the working directory.</li>

        <li>If you wish to introduce new quantities, it may help to use
        the <a href="https://github.com/kdavies4/QCalc/blob/master/QCalc/Resources/quantities.xlsx?raw=true">quantities.xlsx</a> spreadsheet.</li>

        <li>There are more details about the implementation in
        <a href="QCalc_Units.html#QCalc.Units">QCalc.Units</a>.</li>

<h4><font color="green" size=4><a name="ModelicaLicense2">The Modelica License 2</a></font></h4>

<p><b>Preamble.</b> The goal of this license is that Modelica related
model libraries, software, images, documents, data files etc. can be
used freely in the original or a modified form, in open source and in
commercial environments (as long as the license conditions below are
fulfilled, in particular sections 2c) and 2d). The Original Work is
provided free of charge and the use is completely at your own risk.
Developers of free Modelica packages are encouraged to utilize this
license for their work.</p>

<p>The Modelica License applies to any Original Work that contains the
following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice(s) for
this Original Work:</p>

<p><b>Licensed by the <a href="http://www.hnei.hawaii.edu/"><span id="_publisher7" itemprop="publisher" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization">
<span itemprop="name">Hawaii Natural Energy Institute</span></span></a> under the Modelica License 2</b></p>

<p><b>1. Definitions.</b></p>
<ol type="a">
        <li>&ldquo;License&rdquo; is this Modelica License.</li>

        <li>&ldquo;Original Work&rdquo; is any work of authorship, including
        software, images, documents, data files, that contains the above
        licensing notice or that is packed together with a licensing notice
        referencing it.</li>

        <li>&ldquo;Licensor&rdquo; is the provider of the Original Work who has
        placed this licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice(s) for
        the Original Work. The Original Work is either directly provided by
        the owner of the Original Work, or by a licensee of the owner.</li>

        <li>&ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo; is any modification of the Original
        Work which represents, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
        For the matter of clarity and as examples:

        <ol type="A">
                <li>Derivative Work shall not include work that remains separable from
                the Original Work, as well as merely extracting a part of the
                Original Work without modifying it.</li>

                <li>Derivative Work shall not include (a) fixing of errors and/or (b)
                adding vendor-specific Modelica annotations and/or (c) using a
                subset of the classes of a Modelica package, and/or (d) using a
                different representation, e.g., a binary representation.</li>

                <li>Derivative Work shall include classes that are copied from the
                Original Work where declarations, equations or the documentation
                are modified.</li>

                <li>Derivative Work shall include executables to simulate the models
                that are generated by a Modelica translator based on the Original
                Work (of a Modelica package).</li>
        </ol>

        <li>&ldquo;Modified Work&rdquo; is any modification of the Original Work
        with the following exceptions: (a) fixing of errors and/or (b)
        adding vendor-specific Modelica annotations and/or (c) using a
        subset of the classes of a Modelica package, and/or (d) using a
        different representation, e.g., a binary representation.</li>

        <li>&quot;Source Code&quot; means the preferred form of the Original
        Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation
        describing how to modify the Original Work.</li>

        <li>&ldquo;You&rdquo; means an individual or a legal entity exercising
        rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License.</li>

        <li>&ldquo;Modelica package&rdquo; means any Modelica library that is
        defined with the &ldquo;<code><b>package</b>&nbsp;&lt;Name&gt;&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;<b>end</b>&nbsp;&lt;Name&gt;;</code>&rdquo; Modelica language element.</li>

</ol>

<p><b>2. Grant of Copyright License.</b> Licensor grants You a
worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for
the duration of the copyright, to do the following:</p>

<ol type="a">
        <li><p>To reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of
        a collection.</p></li>
        <li><p>To create Derivative Works according to Section 1d) of this License.</p></li>
        <li><p>To distribute or communicate to the public copies of the <u>Original
        Work</u> or a <u>Derivative Work</u> under <u>this License</u>. No
        fee, neither as a copyright-license fee, nor as a selling fee for
        the copy as such may be charged under this License. Furthermore, a
        verbatim copy of this License must be included in any copy of the
        Original Work or a Derivative Work under this License.<br>
        For the matter of clarity, it is permitted A) to distribute or
        communicate such copies as part of a (possible commercial)
        collection where other parts are provided under different licenses
        and a license fee is charged for the other parts only and B) to
        charge for mere printing and shipping costs.</p></li>
        <li><p>To distribute or communicate to the public copies of a <u>Derivative
        Work</u>, alternatively to Section 2c), under <u>any other license</u>
        of your choice, especially also under a license for
        commercial/proprietary software, as long as You comply with Sections
        3, 4 and 8 below.<br>      For the matter of clarity, no
        restrictions regarding fees, either as to a copyright-license fee or
        as to a selling fee for the copy as such apply.</p></li>
        <li><p>To perform the Original Work publicly.</p></li>
        <li><p>To display the Original Work publicly.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>3. Acceptance.</b> Any use of the Original Work or a
Derivative Work, or any action according to either Section 2a) to 2f)
above constitutes Your acceptance of this License.</p>

<p><b>4. Designation of Derivative Works and of Modified Works.
</b>The identifying designation of Derivative Work and of Modified
Work must be different to the corresponding identifying designation
of the Original Work. This means especially that the (root-level)
name of a Modelica package under this license must be changed if the
package is modified (besides fixing of errors, adding vendor-specific
Modelica annotations, using a subset of the classes of a Modelica
package, or using another representation, e.g. a binary
representation).</p>

<p><b>5. Grant of Patent License.</b>
Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license,
under patent claims owned by the Licensor or licensed to the Licensor by
the owners of the Original Work that are embodied in the Original Work
as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents,
to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work
and Derivative Works under the conditions as given in Section 2.
For the matter of clarity, the license regarding Derivative Works covers
patent claims to the extent as they are embodied in the Original Work only.</p>

<p><b>6. Provision of Source Code.</b> Licensor agrees to provide
You with a copy of the Source Code of the Original Work but reserves
the right to decide freely on the manner of how the Original Work is
provided.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the matter of clarity, Licensor might provide only a binary
representation of the Original Work. In that case, You may (a) either
reproduce the Source Code from the binary representation if this is
possible (e.g., by performing a copy of an encrypted Modelica
package, if encryption allows the copy operation) or (b) request the
Source Code from the Licensor who will provide it to You.</p>

<p><b>7. Exclusions from License Grant.</b> Neither the names of
Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor
any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or
promote products derived from this Original Work without express
prior permission of the Licensor. Except as otherwise expressly
stated in this License and in particular in Sections 2 and 5, nothing
in this License grants any license to Licensor&rsquo;s trademarks,
copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual
property, and no patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer
for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No license is granted to the trademarks of
Licensor even if such trademarks are included in the Original Work,
except as expressly stated in this License. Nothing in this License
shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms
different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise
would have a right to license.</p>

<p><b>8. Attribution Rights.</b> You must retain in the Source
Code of the Original Work and of any Derivative Works that You
create, all author, copyright, patent, or trademark notices, as well
as any descriptive text identified therein as an &quot;Attribution
Notice&quot;. The same applies to the licensing notice of this
License in the Original Work. For the matter of clarity, &ldquo;author
notice&rdquo; means the notice that identifies the original
author(s).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative
Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice
reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the
Original Work.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case the Original Work or Derivative Work is not provided in
Source Code, the Attribution Notices shall be appropriately
displayed, e.g., in the documentation of the Derivative Work.</p>

<p><b>9. Disclaimer
of Warranty.<br><u>The Original Work is provided under this
License on an &quot;as is&quot; basis and without warranty, either
express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of
non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular
purpose. The entire risk as to the quality of the Original Work is
with You.</u></b> This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an
essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is
granted by this License except under this disclaimer.</p>

<p><b>10. Limitation of Liability.</b> Under no circumstances and
under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor, the owner or a licensee
of the Original Work be liable to anyone for any direct, indirect,
general, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of this License or the use of the
Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability
shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such
limitation.</p>

<p><b>11. Termination.</b> This License conditions your rights to
undertake the activities listed in Section 2 and 5, including your
right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and
doing so without observing these terms and conditions is prohibited
by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is
intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations. This License
shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the
rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to observe
the conditions of this license.</p>

<p><b>12. Termination for Patent Action.</b> This License shall
terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the
rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an
action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor,
any owners of the Original Work or any licensee alleging that the
Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall
not apply for an action alleging patent infringement through
combinations of the Original Work under combination with other
software or hardware.</p>

<p><b>13. Jurisdiction.</b> Any action or suit relating to this
License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein
the Licensor resides and under the laws of that jurisdiction
