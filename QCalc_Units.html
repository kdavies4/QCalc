<p>The text below introduces, justifies, and explains the implementation of physical units in
    <a href="index.html#QCalc">QCalc</a>.
    For an overview of how to use
    <a href="index.html#QCalc">QCalc</a>, please
see the <a href="index.html#QCalc">top-level documentation</a>
and the <a href="QCalc_UsersGuide.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.GettingStarted">getting started page</a>.
This text has been updated and adapted from
[<a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_Publications.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.Publications.Davies2012">Davies2012</a>].
That paper also suggests how the approach might be
better integrated in the <a href="http://www.modelica.org">Modelica
language</a>.  Please also see the documentation
of the <a href="QCalc_Quantities.html#QCalc.Quantities">Quantities</a> package.</p>

<p><b>Introduction:</b></p>

<p>In mathematical models, one uses variables to represent
physical quantities. As stated by the Bureau International des Poids et
Mesures (BIPM) [<a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_References.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.References.BIPM2006">BIPM2006</a>,
p.&nbsp;103]:</p> <blockquote> "The value of a quantity
is generally expressed as the product of a number and a unit.  The unit
is simply a particular example of the quantity concerned which is used as
a reference, and the number is the ratio of the value of the quantity to
the unit." </blockquote> <p>In general, a unit may be the product of
other units raised to various powers.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.modelica.org">Modelica</a>, a physical
quantity is represented by a <code>Real</code> variable.
Its <code>value</code> attribute is a number
associated with the value of the quantity (not the value of the quantity
itself, as will be shown).  Usually the <code>value</code> attribute is
not explicitly referenced because it is automatically returned when the
variable itself is referenced. The <code>unit</code> attribute is a string that
describes the unit by which the value of the quantity has been divided to
arrive at the number.  The <code>displayUnit</code> attribute (also a
string) describes the unit by which the value of the quantity should be
divided to arrive at the number as it is entered by or presented to the
user.  The <code>Real</code> type contains other attributes as well,
including the <code>quantity</code> string.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://build.openmodelica.org/Documentation/Modelica.SIunits.html#Modelica.SIunits">SIunits</a> package of the
<a href="http://build.openmodelica.org/Documentation/Modelica.html#Modelica">Modelica Standard Library</a> contains
types that extend the <code>Real</code> type.  The type definitions
modify the <code>unit</code>, <code>displayUnit</code>, and
<code>quantity</code> attributes (among others) to represent various
physical quantities.  The <code>unit</code> and <code>displayUnit</code>
attributes are based on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">International System of Units</a> (Syst&egrave;me
international d'unit&eacute;s, SI). The <code>quantity</code> string is
the name of the physical quantity.  For example, the
<a href="http://build.openmodelica.org/Documentation/Modelica.SIunits.html#Modelica.SIunits.Velocity">Velocity</a>  type has a
<code>unit</code> of "m/s" and a <code>quantity</code> of "Velocity".
If an instance of <a href="http://build.openmodelica.org/Documentation/Modelica.SIunits.html#Modelica.SIunits.Velocity">Velocity</a>
has a <code>value</code> of one (<i>v</i> = 1), then it is
meant that "the value of velocity is one metre per second."  Again, the
<code>value</code> attribute represents the number, or the value of the
quantity divided by the unit, not the value of the quantity itself.</p>

<p>This conflict is solved in <a href="index.html#QCalc">QCalc</a>
by establishing units as mathematical entities and writing
<i>v</i> = 1&nbsp;m/s (in code, <code>v = 1*U.m/U.s</code> or simply
<code>v = U.m/U.s</code>, where <code>U</code> is an abbreviation for this
package). Here, the variable <i>v</i> directly represents the quantity.
Its <code>value</code> attribute is truly the value of the quantity in the
context of the statement by <a href="http://www.bipm.org/">BIPM</a> (above). One advantage is that unit
conversion is built in.  The essence of unit conversion is that the
phrase "value of quantity in unit" typically means "value of
quantity divided by unit."  Continuing with the previous example,
<i>v</i> is divided by m/s in order to display <i>v</i> in metres per
second (as a number).  If another unit of length like the foot is
established by the appropriate relation (ft &asymp; 0.3048&nbsp;m) and
<i>v</i> is divided by ft/s, the result is velocity in feet per second
(&sim;3.2894).  Some units such as &deg;C, Pag, and dB involve offsets or
nonaffine transformations between the value of the quantity and the
number; these are described by functions besides simple division.</p>

<p><b>Method:</b></p>

<p>In <a href="index.html#QCalc">QCalc</a>, each <a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_Glossary.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.Glossary.'linear unit'">linear unit</a> is a constant
quantity. The value of a unit, like other quantities, is the product
of a number and a unit. Therefore, units may be derived from other units
(e.g., Pa = N/m<sup>2</sup>). This recursive definition leaves several
units (in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">SI</a>, 7)
that are locally independent and must be established
universally.  These base units are established by the "particular example
of the quantity concerned which is used as a reference" quoted previously
[<a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_References.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.References.BIPM2006">BIPM2006</a>].
The choice of the base units is somewhat arbitrary [<a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_References.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.References.Fritzson2004">Fritzson2004</a>,
p.&nbsp;375], but regardless, there are a number of
units that must be defined by example.</p>

<p>If only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">SI</a>
will be used, then it is easiest to set each of the base
units of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">SI</a>
equal to one&mdash;the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre">metre</a> (m),
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram">kilogram</a> (kg),
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second">second</a> (s),
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere">ampere</a> (A),
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin">kelvin</a> (K),
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit)">mole</a> (mol), and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela">candela</a> (cd).  This is implicitly
the case in the <a href="http://build.openmodelica.org/Documentation/Modelica.SIunits.html#Modelica.SIunits">SIunits</a>
package, but again, it hardly captures the idea that the value of a
quantity is the product of a number and a unit.</p>

<p>Instead, in <a href="index.html#QCalc">QCalc</a>, the values of the base units are
established from physical constants. This approach reflects the
way that standards organizations (e.g., <a href="http://www.nist.gov/">NIST</a>)
define modern units.
The "particular example of the quantity"
[<a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_References.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.References.BIPM2006">BIPM2006</a>] is
an experiment that yields precise and universally repeatable results
rather than a prototype (e.g., the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prototype_Kilogram#International_prototype_kilogram">international
prototype kilogram</a>) which is carefully controlled and distributed
via replicas.  This approach also makes it easy to normalize certain constants
as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_units">natural unit systems</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the values of the constants can be chosen to
scale the values of variables.  There are physical systems where typical quantities are many orders of
magnitude larger or smaller than the related product of powers of base SI
units (e.g., the domains of astrophysics and atomic physics).  In modeling
those systems, it may help to choose
appropriately small or large values (respectively) for the corresponding
base units so that the product of the number (large or small in magnitude)
and the unit (small or large, respectively) is well-scaled.  This
scaling is usually unnecessary due to the wide range and appropriate
distribution of the real numbers that are representable in floating
point.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>  However, in some cases it may improve
computational performance to scale the units and use lower precision.
There are fields of research where, even today, simulations are sometimes
performed in single precision [<a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_References.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.References.Brown2011">Brown2011</a>,
<a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_References.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.References.Hess2008">Hess2008</a>] and
where scaling is a concern [<a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_References.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.References.Rapaport2004">Rapaport2004</a>,
p.&nbsp;29]. The number and the
unit are usually multiplied before the dynamic simulation or even during translation
because the product is often involved in initial conditions or parameter
expressions.
During the simulation, only the value is important, so there is no computational
overhead.  The
value is divided by the display unit after the simulation.</p>

<p>The method is neutral with regards to not only the values of the base
units, but also the choice of the base units and even the number of base
units.  This is an advantage because many systems of units besides
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">SI</a> are
used in science and engineering. As mentioned previously, the choice of
base units is somewhat arbitrary, and different systems of units are based
on different choices.  Some systems of units have fewer base units (lower
rank) than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">SI</a>, since additional constraints are added that exchange base
units for derived units.  For example, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units">Planck</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoney_units">Stoney</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_units">Hartree</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_units">Rydberg</a> systems of units set the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant">Boltzmann constant</a> equal to one
(<i>k</i><sub>B</sub> = 1)
[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_units">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_units</a>].
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin">kelvin</a> is eliminated
[<a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_References.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.References.Greiner1995">Greiner1995</a>,
p.&nbsp;386] or, more precisely, considered a derived
unit instead of a base unit.  In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">SI</a>,
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin">kelvin</a> would be derived from the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram">kilogram</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre">metre</a>, and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second">second</a>, (K &asymp;
1.381&times;10<sup>-23</sup>&nbsp;kg&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>).
In this case, temperature is not an independent dimension.</p>

<p>There are seven base constants in the
<a href="QCalc_Units.html#QCalc.Units">Units</a> package (<i>R</i><sub>&infin;</sub>,
<i>c</i>, <i>k</i><sub>J</sub>, R<sub>K</sub>,
<i>k</i><sub>F</sub>, <i>R</i>, and <i>k</i><sub>A</sub>'; see
<a href="QCalc_Units_Bases.html#QCalc.Units.Bases">Units.Bases</a>)
and seven SI base units (m, s, kg, A, K, mol, and cd).
The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela">candela</a> (cd) is decoupled from these constants
by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity_function">luminosity function</a>,
but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian">radian</a> (rad) is derived from them.</p>

<p><b>Implementation:</b></p>

<p>The units and constants are defined as variables in this
<a href="QCalc_Units.html#QCalc.Units">Units</a> package.  Each is a
<code>constant</code> of the appropriate type from the
<a href="QCalc_Quantities.html#QCalc.Quantities">Quantities</a> package. The first
section of this package establishes mathematical constants.  The next section
establishes the independent base constants, which are grouped in a
<code>replaceable</code> record.  The third section derives
other physical constants from the base constants.
The fourth section establishes units from the base constants
using  transcendental and empirical relations.  The rest of the
code derives additional units and constants from those units.
All of the units from [<a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_References.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.References.BIPM2006">BIPM2006</a>] are
defined, which includes the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">SI</a> units and
some non-SI units.  Other units are included for convenience.
Some prefixed units are defined as well, but most
must be expressed using separate factors (e.g.,
<code>U.Prefixes.k*U.m</code>).</p>

<p>Some units such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius">Celsius</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel">decibel</a> involve functions other than multiplication.
These units are called <a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_Glossary.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.Glossary.'lambda unit'">lambda units</a> and are defined via
 operator records.  The <code>*</code> and <code>/</code> operators are overloaded
 to call the unit's transformation and its inverse, respectively.</p>

<p>This package (<a href="QCalc_Units.html#QCalc.Units">QCalc.Units</a>) is
abbreviated as <code>U</code> for convenience throughout the rest of
<a href="index.html#QCalc">QCalc</a>, and
<a href="QCalc_Quantities.html#QCalc.Quantities">QCalc.Quantities</a> is
abbreviated as <code>Q</code>.</p>

<p>The <a href="QCalc_Units.html#QCalc.Units.setup">Units.setup</a> function
establishes unit conversions using the values of the units, constants, and
prefixes.  These conversions may include offsets. The function also
sets the default display units.  It is automatically called when
<a href="index.html#QCalc">QCalc</a> is loaded from the
<a href="https://github.com/kdavies4/QCalc/blob/master/load.mos">load.mos</a> script.  It can also be called
manually from the "Re-initialize the units" command available in the
Modelica development environment from the <a href="QCalc_Units.html#QCalc.Units">Units</a>
package and its subpackages.  A spreadsheet
(<a href="https://github.com/kdavies4/QCalc/blob/master/QCalc/Resources/quantities.xls?raw=true">Resources/quantities.xls</a>)
is available to help maintain the quantities, default units, and the setup
function.</p>

<p>The values of the units, constants, and prefixes can be evaluated by
translating the <a href="QCalc_Units_Examples.html#QCalc.Units.Examples.Evaluate">Units.Examples.Evaluate</a>
model.  This defines the values in the workspace of the development
environment. For convenience, the <a href="https://github.com/kdavies4/QCalc/blob/master/load.mos">load.mos</a>
script automatically translates that model and saves the result as "units.mos" in the working
directory.</p>

<p>In order to interpret the simulation results stored in a file, it is necessary to know
the values of the base constants.  Since these may be changed, it is a good idea to
drop <a href="QCalc_Units.html#QCalc.Units.UnitSystem">QCalc.Units.UnitSystem</a>
into your model to record the values of the base constants in the results.</p>

<p>Although it is not necessary since
<a href="http://www.modelica.org">Modelica</a> is acausal, the declarations in this
package are sorted so that they can be easily ported to imperative/causal
languages (e.g., <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>
and C).</p>

<p><b>Some notes on angle:</b></p>

<p>As mentioned on the <a href="QCalc_UsersGuide.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.GettingStarted">getting started</a> page and
in the <a href="QCalc_Quantities.html#QCalc.Quantities">Quantities</a>
package, angle is a dimension.  This is different from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">SI</a>,
where angle is considered dimensionless (rad = 1)
[<a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>
Units of angle such as the cycle (cyc),
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian">radian</a> (rad), and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)">degree</a> (deg) must be explicitly included in the expression of
quantities, but they often cancel in equations relating quantities.  The following
differences are noted from the traditional
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">SI</a>
representation:
<ol>

<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian">radian</a> is defined as the cycle divided by two pi (rad =
cyc/2&pi;), which is not necessarily one because angle is derived from the
independent base constants (as mentioned above).</li>

<li>Solid angle has the dimensionality of
squared angle. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steradian">streradian</a> (sr) is defined as the
squared radian (rad<sup>2</sup>), not one.</li>

<li>Frequency and rotational velocity have the dimensionality of angle per time.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz">hertz</a> (Hz) is defined as cyc/s (not s<sup>-1</sup>).</li>

<li>The cross product (&times;) introduces a
factor of rad<sup>-1</sup>.  This means that:
<ul><li>Torque, defined as <b><i>r</i></b>&times;<b><i>F</i></b>, has the dimensionality of energy per angle.
Where J or N&nbsp;m is traditionally used to express torque, J/rad (or N&nbsp;m/rad) should be used.</li>
<li>A factor of 2&pi; appears in the the Maxwell-Faraday equation and Amp&egrave;re's circuital law of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations">Maxwell's equations</a>:
<ul><li>&nabla;&times;<b><i>E</i></b> = -2&pi;&nbsp;&part;<b><i>B</i></b>/&part;<i>t</i></li>
<li>&nabla;&times;<b><i>B</i></b> = 2&pi;&nbsp;&mu;<sub>0</sub>(<i>J</i> + &epsilon;<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;&part;<b><i>E</i></b>/&part;<i>t</i>)
(This formation is also based on other points below.)</li>
</li>
</li>

<li>Rotational momentum has a factor of angle in the denominator.
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant">Planck constant</a> (<i>h</i>)
can be expressed in J/Hz or
J&nbsp;s/rad (but not J&nbsp;s): <ul>
<li><i>h</i>&nbsp;cyc &asymp; 6.626&times;10<sup>-34</sup>&nbsp;J&nbsp;s (the
traditional expression of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant">Planck constant</a>
[<a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_References.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.References.NIST2010">NIST2010</a>])</li>
<li><i>h</i>&nbsp;rad &asymp; 1.055&times;10<sup>-34</sup>&nbsp;J&nbsp;s (the
traditional expression of the reduced Planck constant
[<a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_References.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.References.NIST2010">NIST2010</a>])</li></ul></li>
<li>The quantum of circulation (rotational momentum per mass) is expressed as:
<ul>
<li>kappa &asymp; 3.637&times;10<sup>-4</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>/(cyc&nbsp;s)</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Rotational inertia has a factor of squared angle in the denominator.  It can be expressed in
kg&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>/rad<sup>2</sup>.</li>

<li>Wavenumber has the dimensionality of angle per
length.  Where m<sup>-1</sup> (or cm<sup>-1</sup>, etc.) is traditionally used to express wavenumber,
cyc/m (or cyc/cm, etc.) should be used instead.  Reciprocally, wavelength has the dimensionality of length per angle
and is expressed using m/cyc (or cm/cyc, etc.). This implies that:
<ul><li><i>R</i><sub>&infin;</sub> &asymp; 10973732&nbsp;cyc/m</li>
<li><i>c</i><sub>2</sub> = 1.439&times;10<sup>-2</sup>&nbsp;m&nbsp;K/cyc</li>
<li><i>c</i><sub>3&nbsp;&lambda;</sub> &asymp; 2.898&times;10<sup>-3</sup>&nbsp;m&nbsp;K/cyc</li>
<li>&lambda;<sub>e</sub>&nbsp;cyc &asymp; 2.426&times;10<sup>-12</sup>&nbsp;m (The right side is the traditional expression
of the electron's Compton wavelength
[<a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_References.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.References.NIST2010">NIST2010</a>].)</li>
<li>&lambda;<sub>e</sub>&nbsp;rad  &asymp; 386.2&times;10<sup>-15</sup>&nbsp;m (The right side is the traditional expression of the
electron's Compton wavelength over 2&nbsp;&pi;
[<a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_References.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.References.NIST2010">NIST2010</a>].)</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Magnetic flux and related quantities have a factor of angle in the denominator.
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_(unit)">weber</a> (Wb) is defined as V/Hz or V&nbsp;s/cyc (not V&nbsp;s).</li>
<li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Klitzing_constant">von Klitzing constant</a>
and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impedance_of_free_space">characteristic impedance of vacuum</a>
are expressed as: <ul>
<li><i>R</i><sub>K</sub> &asymp; 25813&nbsp;&Omega;/cyc</li>
<li><i>Z</i><sub>0</sub> &asymp; 376.7&nbsp;&Omega;/cyc</li></ul>
since they are quantities of magnetic flux per charge.
Reciprocally, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductance_quantum">conductance quantum</a> has a
factor of angle in the numerator:<ul>
<li><i>G</i><sub>0</sub> &asymp; 7.748&times;10<sup>-5</sup>&nbsp;S&nbsp;cyc</li></ul>
</li>
<li>The fine-structure constant (<i>k</i><sub>A</sub>&nbsp;<i>c</i>/<i>R</i><sub>K</sub>) is therefore an angle:
<ul>
<li>&alpha;/rad &asymp; 7.297&times;10<sup>-3</sup> (The right side is the traditional expression
[<a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_References.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.References.NIST2010">NIST2010</a>].)
</li>
</ul>
<li>A factor of cyc must be added to the denominator of the
<a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?aumfd">traditional
symbolic expression of the atomic unit of magnetic flux density</a>.</li>
</ul>

<li>The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permeability">magnetic constant</a>
has a factor of squared angle in the denominator:<ul>
<li>&mu;<sub>0</sub> = 4&pi;&times;10<sup>-7</sup>&nbsp;H/(m&nbsp;cyc<sup>2</sup>) = 2<i>k</i><sub>A</sub>/(cyc&nbsp;rad),
where 2<i>k</i><sub>A</sub> is the factor in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re's_force_law">Amp&egrave;re's force law</a>.</li>
</ul>
In the basic equation for the inductance of a solenoid in vacuum, <i>N</i> (the number of turns)
is replaced by the angle of the wound coil (&theta; = <i>N</i>&nbsp;cyc):
<ul>
<li><i>L</i> = &mu;<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;&theta;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<i>A</i>/&#8467;.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>The auxiliary magnetic field (<i>H</i>), magnetic moment, and related quantities have a factor of angle in the
numerator.  <ul>
<li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oersted">oersted</a> is expressed as:
<ul>
<li>Oe = (10<sup>3</sup>/4&pi;) AT/m, where AT is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere-turn">ampere-turn</a> (AT = A&nbsp;cyc)</li>
</ul>
but the cycle or turn is traditionally neglected [<a href="http://www.bipm.org/">BIPM</a>].</li>
<li>
A factor of cyc must be added to the
<a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?aumdm">traditional
symbolic expression of the atomic unit of magnetic dipole moment</a>.</li></ul></li>

<li>It follows that magnetizability, the ratio between magnetic moment and magnetic flux density,
has squared angle in the numerator.  A factor of cyc<sup>2</sup> must be added to the
<a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?aumag">traditional
symbolic expression of the atomic unit of magnetizability</a>.</li>

<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_(unit)">henry</a> (H) is defined as V&nbsp;s/A (not Wb/A).
Although it related to magnetics, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_(unit)">henry</a> is applied to
electrical circuits, so it does not include any factors of angle.
</li>

<li>Traditional trigonometric functions accept angles in radians.  Angles should be divided by
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian">radian</a> (<code>U.rad</code>) before passing to these functions
(e.g., <code>sin(theta/U.rad)</code>) and the result of their inverses should be multiplied by
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian">radian</a> (e.g., <code>asin(x)*U.rad</code>).</li>

<li>The first radiation constant has a factor of angle to the fourth power in the denominator:
  <ul><li>
  <i>c</i><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;cyc<sup>4</sup> &asymp; 3.742&times;10<sup>-16</sup>&nbsp;W&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> (The right
  side is the traditional expression
  [<a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_References.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.References.NIST2010">NIST2010</a>].)
  </ul></li>
  </li>
  </ol></p>

<p>The explicit inclusion of angle has several advantages.  First, it
avoids a conflict in the definition of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">SI units</a>.
<a href="http://www.bipm.org/">BIPM</a> defines the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz">hertz</a>
as the reciprocal second (Hz = s<sup>-1</sup>), but states that "The SI
unit of frequency is given as the hertz, implying the unit cycles per
second" [<a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_References.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.References.BIPM2006">BIPM2006</a>].
Due to trigonometry (cyc = 2&pi;&nbsp;rad), <a href="http://www.bipm.org/">BIPM</a>'s
definition of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian">radian</a> as one (rad = 1)
implies that the cycle is two pi
(cyc = 2&pi;) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz_(unit)">hertz</a>
is not cycles per second but rather cycles per
second divided by two pi (Hz = cyc/(2&pi;&nbsp;s)).</p>

<p>The second advantage is that the use of explicit angles avoids
the potential confusion between energy and torque in SI
[<a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_References.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.References.BIPM2006">BIPM2006</a>].
Torque is expressed as the cross product
of force and radius. The cross product introduces a factor of rad<sup>-1</sup>,
so the result is energy per angle, which is clearly
distinct from energy.  The angle cancels in the expression of rotational
power&mdash;the product of torque and rotational velocity (angle per time).</p>

<p>Also, the inclusion of angle avoids the
need to use different variables depending on the chosen unit of angle.
For example, frequency is sometimes represented by a variable in hertz
(e.g., &nu;) and other times by a variable in radians per second (e.g.,
&omega;).  If angle is explicit, then one variable will suffice (<i>f</i> =
&nu;&nbsp;cyc/s = &omega;&nbsp;rad/s).  As alluded to earlier, there is no need for the
reduced Planck constant (i.e., <i>h</i> &asymp;
6.6261&times;10<sup>-34</sup>&nbsp;J/Hz &asymp; 1.0546&times;10<sup>-34</sup>&nbsp;J&nbsp;s/rad).</p>

<p>Fourth, if angle is counted as a dimension, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-structure_constant">fine-structure constant</a> is not
dimensionless.  This addresses the conundrum of a dimensionless constant that cannot be
mathematically derived.</p>

<p>Another possible advantage appears if we define the size of a circle
(<i>S</i>) as length per angle&mdash;radius per radian (<i>r</i>/rad)
or, equivalently, circumference per cycle.  This simplifies the
representation of some common equations because explicit factors of 2&pi; are eliminated.
The circumference of one circle is <i>S</i>&nbsp;cyc.  The surface area of
one sphere is <i>S</i><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;sp, where sp = 4&pi;&nbsp;sr is the
spat, a unit of solid angle.<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>
Coulomb's force law can be expressed using the electric constant (&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>) without
a explicit factor of 1/4&pi;:
<blockquote>
 <i>F</i> = (1/&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>)&nbsp;<i>q</i><sub>1</sub><i>q</i><sub>2</sub>/(<i>S</i><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;sp)
</blockquote>
where <i>S</i><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;sp is the surface area of the sphere centered at one
charge and touching the other.
Since <i>S</i> = <i>r</i>/rad, sp = 4&pi;&nbsp;sr, and sr = rad<sup>2</sup>,
this is
<blockquote>
 <i>F</i> = <i>k</i><sub>C</sub>&nbsp;<i>q</i><sub>1</sub><i>q</i><sub>2</sub>/<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>
 </blockquote>
where <i>k</i><sub>C</sub> is the electric constant, which is
1/(4&pi;&nbsp;&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>) as expected.
Thus, there may not be a
need to maintain the electric force constant as a separate variable from
the electric constant.</p>

<hr>

<p id="fn1"><small>1. The Modelica specification recommends that floating point
numbers be represented in at least IEEE double precision, which covers
magnitudes from &sim;2.225&times;10<sup>-308</sup> to
&sim;1.798&times;10<sup>308</sup> [<a href="QCalc_UsersGuide_References.html#QCalc.UsersGuide.References.Modelica2010">Modelica2010</a>,
p.&nbsp;13].</small></p>

<p id="fn2"><small>2. The common argument that angle is
dimensionless ("angle is a ratio of lengths") is flawed.
Angle is the not the ratio of arclength to radius.
Rather, angle in radians is the ratio of arclength to radius
(&theta;/rad = <i>L</i>/<i>r</i>).  It is not necessary that angle
(&theta;)   is dimensionless, only that angle and radian (rad) have the
same dimension.   In <a href="index.html#QCalc">QCalc</a>, that
dimension is called angle.   The common (and correct) understanding is
that the radian (rad) is a unit of angle,   just as the metre (m) is a
unit of length.  The dimensionality of the radian  is angle, just as
the dimensionality of the metre is length.</small></p>

<p id="fn3"><small>3. The spat (sp) is the solid angle of one sphere, just
as the cycle (cyc) is the angle of one circle.  For mnemonic purposes, sp can be
considered as the abbreviation for sphere as well as spat.</small></p>
